name: gitpush
description: Safely push code to GitHub while preventing sensitive files. Use when the user asks to push, publish, or sync code to GitHub, or mentions git push/branching.
---

# gitpush

## Purpose
Push code to GitHub following basic industry practices, with explicit repo/branch confirmation and strict sensitive-file exclusions.

## Required Safety Rules
- Never push `.env`, `.claude/**`, credentials, or secrets (e.g., keys, tokens, config with secrets).
- Never push `.gitignore` — unstage it silently if it's staged.
- Never push `memory.md` — unstage it silently if it's staged.
- Always review `git status` and `git diff` before pushing.
- **Always ask the user which repo and branch to push to — never assume.**
- Always show a final confirmation summary and get explicit approval before committing or pushing.
- Never force-push unless explicitly requested.
- If this is the first push (no remote history), ensure a `README.md` exists before pushing.
- **"Chat about this" = full stop.** Every hook includes a "Chat about this" option. If selected, stop the workflow completely, read what the user says, and respond. Do NOT continue pushing. Resume only when they explicitly say to.
- **Always verify commits are attributed to the correct account.** Run `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` and confirm both match:
  - `user.name` = `ashcastelinocs124`
  - `user.email` = `ashleyn4@illinois.edu`
  - If either is wrong, run `git config user.name "ashcastelinocs124"` and `git config user.email "ashleyn4@illinois.edu"` to fix before committing.

## Stored GitHub Identity
- **Username:** `ashcastelinocs124`
- **Email:** `ashleyn4@illinois.edu`
- Always verify and fix git config to match before committing (see Step 1).

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Confirm target repo (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

Run `git remote -v` first. Then ask:

**If a remote is already set:**
```
question: "Push to <current remote URL>?"
header: "Target repo"
options:
  - label: "Yes — push here"
    description: "<current remote URL>"
  - label: "No — different repo"
    description: "I'll pick a different repo"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```
- If "Yes": proceed with current remote.
- If "No": run `gh repo list ashcastelinocs124 --limit 5 --json name,url,updatedAt --sort updated`, show results as options + "Paste a link", set new remote with `git remote set-url origin <url>`.
- If "Chat about this": stop completely and listen.

**If no remote is set:** skip to Step 1.5 (repo selection).

### Step 1 — Gather info
Run `git status`, `git diff`, `git remote -v`, and `git branch` to understand current state.

Also run `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`. If they don't match `ashcastelinocs124` / `ashleyn4@illinois.edu`, fix them now:
```bash
git config user.name "ashcastelinocs124"
git config user.email "ashleyn4@illinois.edu"
```

### Step 1.5 — Repo selection when no remote is set (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

**Trigger:** `git remote -v` returns empty output OR the user did not provide a repo URL.

Run:
```bash
gh repo list ashcastelinocs124 --limit 5 --json name,url,updatedAt --sort updated
```

This returns the 5 most recently updated repos. Build an `AskUserQuestion` from the results:

```
question: "No remote is set. Which GitHub repo should this be pushed to?"
header: "Target repo"
options:
  - label: "<repo-name-1>"
    description: "Last updated: <updatedAt> — github.com/ashcastelinocs124/<repo-name-1>"
  - label: "<repo-name-2>"
    description: "Last updated: <updatedAt> — github.com/ashcastelinocs124/<repo-name-2>"
  - label: "<repo-name-3>"
    description: "Last updated: <updatedAt> — ..."
  - label: "Paste a link"
    description: "I'll provide the full repo URL myself"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

- If user selects a repo from the list: set remote with `git remote add origin <url>` then continue.
- If user selects "Paste a link" or types "Other": ask them to provide the full URL, then `git remote add origin <url>`.
- If user selects "Chat about this": stop completely and listen.
- If `gh` is not authenticated or fails: skip to the "Paste a link" fallback directly.

**Do not assume or guess a repo. Always ask.**

---

### Step 2 — Branch selection (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask which branch to push to. Build the options dynamically from `git branch -a` output:

```
question: "Which branch do you want to push to?"
header: "Target branch"
options:
  - label: "<current branch>"         ← always first
    description: "Push to current branch (currently checked out)"
  - label: "main"                     ← if exists and different from current
    description: "Push to main branch"
  - label: "New branch"
    description: "Create and push to a new branch — I'll ask for the name"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

- If user selects "New branch", ask for the name with a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` or text prompt.
- If user selects "Chat about this": stop completely and listen.
- If pushing to main/master, note: "This pushes directly to the default branch."

### Step 2.5 — Screen recording for README (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

Ask before touching the README:

```
question: "Do you want to record the app and embed a demo in the README?"
header: "Demo recording"
options:
  - label: "Yes — record and embed"
    description: "Invoke the screen-recording skill, render a GIF, and add it to the README"
  - label: "I already have a video — add it"
    description: "I'll paste a YouTube URL or GIF path to embed"
  - label: "No — skip recording"
    description: "Proceed without a demo video"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

**If "Yes — record and embed":**
1. Invoke the `screen-record` skill (see `ashcastelinocs124/public-skill`) to capture the app flow
2. After recording completes, render a GIF: look for a `render:gif` script in package.json or equivalent
3. Commit the GIF to the repo (e.g. `docs/demo.gif` or `video/out/demo.gif`)
4. Add to README at a visible position (below the description, before install steps):
   ```markdown
   ![Demo](docs/demo.gif)
   ```
5. Continue to README check step

**If "I already have a video — add it":**
- If YouTube URL: add a linked thumbnail to README:
  ```markdown
  [![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID)
  ```
- If local GIF path: copy to `docs/` and embed with `![Demo](docs/demo.gif)`
- Continue to README check step

**If "No — skip recording":** continue immediately.
**If "Chat about this":** stop completely and listen.

---

### Step 2.6 — README check (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

Check if a `README.md` exists in the repo root. Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question: "Does the README need to be updated before pushing?"
header: "README update"
options:
  - label: "No, README is fine"
    description: "Proceed without touching the README"
  - label: "Yes, update it"
    description: "I'll describe what changed and you update the README before pushing"
  - label: "No README exists — create one"    ← only show if README is missing
    description: "Generate a basic README before pushing"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

- If user selects "Yes, update it": ask them what to add/change, make the edits, then continue.
- If user selects "create one": generate a minimal README based on the repo contents, show it for approval, then continue.
- If user selects "Chat about this": stop completely and listen.

### Step 3 — Scan for sensitive files
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `.claude/**`
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
- `.gitignore` — always exclude, unstage without asking
- `memory.md` — always exclude, unstage without asking
- Any file containing obvious secrets

If sensitive files are staged or modified, **stop and ask** the user what to do. For `.gitignore` and `memory.md`, unstage them silently with `git reset HEAD <file>` and note it in the confirmation summary.

**Also audit `.gitignore` coverage before staging:**
- `.env` in `.gitignore` does NOT match `.env.local` or `.env.*` — check that all dotenv variants are covered
- If `.gitignore` is missing `.env.*` or `.env.local`, offer to add them before proceeding with `git add`

### Step 4 — Show final confirmation summary + AskUserQuestion gate (BLOCKING — do not skip)

Display the summary to the user:

```
Ready to push:
  Repo:    <remote URL>
  Branch:  <branch name>
  Files:   <list of staged files>
  Commit:  "<proposed commit message>"
  Author:  ashcastelinocs124 <ashleyn4@illinois.edu>  ✓
```

Then **immediately use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** with this exact question:

```
question: "Are you sure you want to push to <branch> on <repo>?"
header: "Confirm push"
options:
  - label: "Yes, push it"
    description: "Proceed with git push"
  - label: "No, cancel"
    description: "Abort — do not push anything"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

**Do NOT run any git commit or git push command until the user selects "Yes, push it".**
**If "No, cancel": abort and tell the user nothing was pushed.**
**If "Chat about this": stop completely, listen to what they say, and wait for them to redirect before doing anything.**

### Step 5 — Execute
1. If first push, verify `README.md` exists; create one only if the user asks.
2. Ensure branch is up to date (pull/rebase if needed) unless user says otherwise.
3. Commit and push to the confirmed repo and branch.

---

### Step 6 — Deploy (BLOCKING — use AskUserQuestion)

After a successful push, always ask:

```
question: "Do you want to deploy after pushing?"
header: "Deploy"
options:
  - label: "No — push only"
    description: "Done. No deployment."
  - label: "Vercel"
    description: "Deploy frontend/fullstack app to Vercel"
  - label: "Railway"
    description: "Deploy backend or full-stack app to Railway"
  - label: "GitHub Pages"
    description: "Deploy static site from /docs or gh-pages branch"
  - label: "Netlify"
    description: "Deploy static site or JAMstack app to Netlify"
  - label: "Chrome Web Store"
    description: "Package and submit extension update to the Chrome Web Store"
  - label: "Chat about this"
    description: "Stop — I want to talk about this first"
```

**If "Chat about this":** stop completely and listen.

#### Platform playbooks

**Vercel:**
```bash
# Install CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel
# Deploy production
vercel --prod
```
- Ask if this is a first deploy (needs `vercel link` first)
- After deploy: print the live URL
- Verify with `curl -s <url> | head -5`

**Railway:**
```bash
railway up --detach
# Then run migrations if applicable
railway run <migrate-command>
```
- After deploy: `railway logs | tail -20` to check for errors
- Print the Railway dashboard URL

**GitHub Pages:**
```bash
# Option A — docs/ folder on main (most common)
# Ensure Settings → Pages → Source = main / docs/
# Nothing to run — GitHub deploys on push automatically

# Option B — gh-pages branch
npx gh-pages -d build   # or 'dist', 'out', '_site'
```
- Ask which option: docs/ folder vs gh-pages branch
- If docs/ folder: confirm Pages is enabled in repo settings, print the Pages URL
- After deploy: `curl -s <pages-url>` to verify it's live

**Netlify:**
```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build  # adjust dir as needed
```
- Ask for the publish directory if not obvious (`build`, `dist`, `out`, `public`)
- After deploy: print the live URL

**Chrome Web Store:**
- Remind user the store has a manual review process (no CLI automation)
- Steps to walk through:
  1. Build the production zip (exclude `node_modules`, `tests/`, dev files)
  2. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
  3. Select the extension → **Package** → **Upload new package** → upload zip
  4. Fill in any updated store listing details
  5. Click **Submit for review**
- Offer to build the zip now: `zip -r extension.zip <src-dir>/ --exclude "*/node_modules/*" --exclude "*/tests/*"`

---

## Example Prompt
User: "push my changes"
Assistant:
1. Run status/diff/remote/branch checks + fix git identity if needed.
2. **If no remote set:** run `gh repo list` → AskUserQuestion with last 5 repos + "Paste a link" option → set remote.
3. AskUserQuestion → "Which branch?" (options: current branch / main / new branch)
4. AskUserQuestion → "Record app for README?" (yes / have video / skip)
5. AskUserQuestion → "Does the README need updating?" (yes / no / create)
6. Scan for sensitive files — stop if any found.
7. Show confirmation summary (repo, branch, files, commit message, author).
8. AskUserQuestion → "Are you sure you want to push?" (Yes, push it / No, cancel)
9. Commit and push only after explicit "Yes, push it".
10. AskUserQuestion → "Deploy?" (No / Vercel / Railway / GitHub Pages / Netlify / Chrome Web Store)
